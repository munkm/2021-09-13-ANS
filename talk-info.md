Introduction of madicken munk

Bio: 
Dr. Madicken Munk is currently a postdoctoral research scholar at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Data Exploration Lab. Her current work centers on making scalable tools for data analysis and visualization for multidimensional data. She earned her PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2017 and performed her dissertation work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and in residence as a member of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. There, she focused on developing implementing and studying an angle-informed hybrid method that was designed for highly anisotropic, deeply-penetrating shielding problems. Dr. Munkâ€™s work lies at the intersection of reactor physics, radiation transport, and high performance computing. In addition to her work in nuclear engineering, Madicken enjoys participating in the SciPy and Carpentries communities where she works to make computing accessible to users of all levels.
